# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging data-driven techniques to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease occurrence in patients based on their medical records and health history. By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models, this system aims to provide valuable insights and predictions to aid in early disease detection and prevention. Through a combination of data analysis and predictive modeling, the project strives to enhance healthcare decision-making and improve patient care outcomes.
